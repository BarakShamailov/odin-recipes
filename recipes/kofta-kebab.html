    <p>
        Throughout the Middle East, just about every country and region have their own version of Kofta with varying ingredients.  It may be called kefta, kifta, kafta, kofta, koobideh, or a myriad of other names. 
    </p>

    <p>
        While traditionally they are served more as meatballs, they are often spread out over a skewer and cooked over the open flame.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kofta is ground meat that is mixed with assorted spices, seasonings, onions, garlic, and parsley, or mint, and is then cooked until browned and cooked throughout.
