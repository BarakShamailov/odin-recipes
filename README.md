In this project i had learned HTML fundmentales:
* How to create links to other pages on my website using the <a> tag.
* How to link images to my website using the <img> tag.
* How to create ordered or unordered lists using <ol> and <ul>.
* How to write headers and understand their sizes using <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>.
* The purpose of the <p> tag.

I enjoyed learning these concepts.
